## Post-Installation

### Verify Installation

**Check recovery features:**
- Touch interface responds
- Storage accessible (or shows encrypted)
- Main menu displays correctly
- Device information shows custom recovery version

**Test ADB access:**

In recovery, enable ADB sideload or check:
```bash
adb devices
```

Should show device in recovery mode.

### Create Backup

::: tip CRITICAL FIRST STEP
Create complete backup before making any modifications. This allows safe recovery if something goes wrong.
:::

**Recommended backup partitions:**

Essential:
- Boot (or vendor_boot/init_boot on modern devices)
- Data (contains all user files and apps)

Important:
- EFS/Modem (IMEI and carrier data)
- Persist (sensor calibration)

Optional:
- System (large, can be restored from ROM)
- Vendor (usually included with ROM)

**Create backup in recovery:**

1. Select "Backup" in recovery main menu
2. Choose partitions to backup
3. Swipe to begin backup
4. Wait for completion (Data backup can be large and slow)

**Transfer backup off-device:**

Using ADB:
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/ backup_folder/
```

Or connect USB and copy via file manager.

**Store backup safely:**
- External hard drive
- Cloud storage
- Multiple locations recommended

### Test Essential Features

**File access:**
- Check if internal storage visible
- If encrypted and not decrypting: use ADB sideload or OTG

**ADB sideload:**
1. In recovery: Advanced > ADB Sideload
2. On computer: `adb sideload test.zip`

**Mount options:**
- Verify system, data, cache mount correctly
- Check if USB OTG works for external storage

### Handle Encryption

Modern devices use File-Based Encryption (FBE) which recovery may not decrypt.

**If storage appears encrypted:**

Option 1: Use ADB
```bash
adb push file.zip /sdcard/
```

Option 2: Use OTG storage
- Connect USB drive via OTG adapter
- Install from OTG in recovery

Option 3: Format data (last resort)
- Removes encryption and all data
- Wipe > Format Data
- Type "yes" to confirm
- Complete data loss

## Essential Operations

### Installing ZIP Files

**Method 1: From internal storage**

1. Copy ZIP to device internal storage
2. In recovery: Install
3. Navigate to ZIP file
4. Swipe to confirm installation
5. Reboot when complete

**Method 2: ADB sideload**

1. In recovery: Advanced > ADB Sideload
2. On computer:
```bash
adb sideload file.zip
```
3. Wait for installation completion
4. Reboot System

**Method 3: OTG storage**

1. Connect USB drive via OTG
2. In recovery: Install
3. Select "USB OTG" storage
4. Navigate to ZIP
5. Swipe to confirm

### Managing Backups

**Create backup:**
- Backup > Select partitions > Swipe to confirm
- Store in safe location off-device

**Restore backup:**
- Restore > Select backup > Choose partitions > Swipe to confirm
- Device returns to backed up state

**Delete old backups:**
- Use recovery file manager or ADB
- Free up storage space regularly

### Wiping Operations

**Factory reset:**
- Wipe > Factory Reset
- Clears data but keeps internal storage on most devices

**Advanced wipe:**
- Wipe > Advanced Wipe
- Select specific partitions:
  - Cache (safe, clears temporary files)
  - Dalvik/ART Cache (safe, rebuilds on boot)
  - Data (removes all apps and settings)
  - System (removes operating system)

::: danger WIPE WARNINGS
**System Wipe** - Removes your operating system. Have ROM ready to install.

**Data Wipe** - Removes all apps, settings, and files.

**Format Data** - Removes encryption and all data. Requires device setup from scratch.

## Modern Device Considerations

### A/B Partition Scheme

**Characteristics:**
- Two system slots (A and B)
- Seamless updates
- No dedicated recovery partition
- Recovery in boot/vendor_boot/init_boot

**Implications:**
- Must use temporary boot or installer ZIP
- OTA updates may remove custom recovery
- Need to reinstall after updates

**Check active slot:**
```bash
fastboot getvar current-slot
```

**Switch slots if needed:**
```bash
fastboot set_active a
# or
fastboot set_active b
```

### Dynamic Partitions

**Characteristics:**
- Flexible partition sizing
- Super partition contains system, vendor, product
- Introduced in Android 10

**Implications:**
- Larger backup sizes
- Different flashing procedures
- Some recoveries may not fully support

### Android Verified Boot (AVB)

**With unlocked bootloader:**
- AVB verification disabled
- Custom recovery and modifications allowed
- No need to flash vbmeta typically

**If issues occur:**
- Check device-specific instructions
- Some devices may need vbmeta modifications

### Fastbootd Mode

**Userspace fastboot for dynamic partitions:**

Enter fastbootd:
```bash
fastboot reboot fastboot
```

Used for:
- Flashing dynamic partitions
- Some ROM installations
- Not typically needed for recovery

### GKI Devices (Generic Kernel Image)

**Android 12+ devices with GKI:**
- Recovery may be in init_boot partition
- Check device instructions carefully
- Use appropriate partition for flashing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Recovery Won't Boot

**Symptoms:** Device stuck on logo or bootloops after recovery flash

**Solutions:**

1. Boot recovery temporarily to test:
```bash
fastboot boot recovery.img
```

2. Verify correct recovery for your device and Android version

3. Flash to correct partition (check device instructions):
```bash
fastboot flash boot recovery.img
# or
fastboot flash vendor_boot recovery.img
# or
fastboot flash init_boot recovery.img
```

4. Restore stock image:
```bash
fastboot flash boot stock_boot.img
```

### Recovery Disappears After Reboot

**Cause:** Device restored stock recovery on first normal boot

**Solution:**

Boot to custom recovery immediately after flashing:
```bash
fastboot reboot recovery
```

Or install root solution (Magisk) which prevents restoration.

### Touch Not Working

**Solutions:**

1. Try different recovery version (newer or older)
2. Use hardware buttons to navigate
3. Check device page for known touch issues
4. Try alternative recovery (OrangeFox if using TWRP)

### Cannot See Internal Storage

**Cause:** Recovery cannot decrypt device encryption

**Solutions:**

Option 1: Use ADB sideload
```bash
adb sideload file.zip
```

Option 2: Use OTG storage
- Connect USB drive
- Install from OTG

Option 3: Format Data (data loss)
- Wipe > Format Data
- Type "yes" to confirm
- Removes encryption and all data

### Fastboot Not Detecting Device

**Solutions:**

1. Install/reinstall USB drivers (Windows)
2. Try USB 2.0 port instead of 3.0
3. Use different USB cable
4. Run as administrator (Windows)
5. Check device appears: `fastboot devices`

### "No OS Installed" Warning

**Cause:** Recovery detects no operating system

**If you didn't wipe system:**
- Warning is false positive
- Reboot System should work

**If you wiped system:**
- Install custom ROM now
- Or restore from backup
- Device won't boot without OS

### Slot Issues (A/B Devices)

**Boot fails after recovery installation:**

Check active slot:
```bash
fastboot getvar current-slot
```

Try other slot:
```bash
fastboot set_active a
fastboot reboot
```

Or:
```bash
fastboot set_active b
fastboot reboot
```

### Installation Errors

**"Remote: Flashing not allowed"**
- Bootloader not fully unlocked
- Some devices need: `fastboot flashing unlock_critical`

**"Remote: Partition doesn't exist"**
- Wrong partition name for your device
- Check device-specific instructions

**"Failed to flash"**
- Corrupt download - redownload recovery
- Wrong recovery variant for device
- USB connection issue - try different port/cable

---

## Emergency Recovery

### Device Won't Boot to Any Mode

1. Try emergency download mode (varies by manufacturer):
   - Qualcomm: EDL mode (test point or special key combo)
   - Samsung: Download mode (Volume Down + Power)
