# GhostLock: Root Android Without Unlocking the Bootloader

**Can Android be rooted without unlocking the bootloader?** Sometimes, but only temporarily and only on a narrow set of vulnerable device builds. GhostLock (CVE-2026-43499) can grant an in-memory root session while the bootloader remains locked; it is not a permanent replacement for bootloader unlocking.

- **What it is:** a device- and security-patch-dependent temporary root technique.
- **What it is not:** persistent root, a bootloader unlock, a way to flash a custom ROM or recovery, or a guarantee that every listed model still works.
- **After reboot:** the session root is gone and the tool must be run again, if the device firmware is still vulnerable.

*The GhostLock bug (CVE-2026-43499), explained in plain English.*

Almost every root method on this site follows the same recipe: **unlock the bootloader, then flash a patched boot image**. But unlocking comes with costs - a wiped phone, a tripped Knox fuse on Samsung devices, a bootloader that reports "unlocked" to banking apps. That's why the discovery of **GhostLock** in mid-2026 caused such a stir: for a narrow window of devices, it delivers root with **none** of that.

This page is the plain-English, complete guide to GhostLock temporary root: what the bug actually is, what it lets you do, what it can *never* do, and every app and project built on it.

> [!TIP]
> **The 30-second version:** GhostLock is a 15-year-old bug in the Linux kernel that Android uses. The right app can trigger it to give itself root *for the current boot only* - no unlocked bootloader, no flashing, no Knox trip, no data wipe. Reboot and root is gone; run the tool again to get it back. It only works on specific devices running firmware up to about the **June 2026** security patch, and it is already being patched out of existence.

## What is GhostLock? (in plain English)

**GhostLock** is the nickname for **CVE-2026-43499**, a high-severity (CVSS 7.8) security bug in the **Linux kernel** - the core that every Android phone runs on. It was publicly disclosed in 2026 by researchers at Nebula Security, whose AI agent VEGA found it; Google paid a **$92,337 bounty** for it through the kernelCTF program, and the researchers' exploit succeeded about **97% of the time** in testing.

Here is the bug without the jargon:

1. When two programs try to use the same resource at the same time, Linux uses **locks** so they take turns. High-priority programs can "inherit" a lock ahead of others - a feature called *priority inheritance*, handled by a kernel component called the **rtmutex/futex** code.
2. When one of those lock operations **fails and rolls back**, the kernel is supposed to clean up after *the process that asked for the lock*. Due to the bug, it cleans up after the **wrong process**.
3. That mistake frees memory while another task still holds a pointer to it - a classic **use-after-free**. The leftover pointer is a "ghost" reference to memory that no longer belongs to anyone - hence the name *GhostLock*.
4. An attacker (or a root app) can deliberately trigger this race and **reclaim that freed memory with their own data**. Since the kernel trusts that memory, the attacker effectively gets a write-into-the-kernel primitive - and from there, full control: **root**.

Two facts make this bug extraordinary:

- **It is old.** The faulty code entered Linux in version **2.6.39, released in 2011** - meaning the bug sat undetected in virtually every Linux system, Android included, for about fifteen years.
- **It is reachable from an ordinary app.** No unlocked bootloader, no developer options, no PC connection required at trigger time - the exploit runs with the permissions of a normal unprivileged app.

The bug affects Linux kernels **2.6.39 through 7.0**. It was fixed in mainline Linux **7.1** (commit `3bfdc63936dd`, April 2026) and backported to stable branches in May 2026 - but Android devices only receive kernel fixes through their OEMs' monthly security bulletins, and several shipping Android kernels, including the **Android GKI 6.12.x** branch common on 2025-2026 flagships, were still vulnerable into mid-2026. That gap between "fixed upstream" and "patched on your phone" is exactly the window the temporary-root tools live in.

## How the temporary root tools actually work

Every GhostLock tool follows roughly the same chain, usually wrapped in a one-tap app:

1. **Stage the payload.** A small native exploit binary is placed on the device - by the app itself, over wireless ADB, or via [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) (which lets apps act with ADB-level powers without full root).
2. **Trigger the bug.** The binary races the faulty lock code, wins, and reclaims the freed kernel memory.
3. **Escalate.** Using the new kernel write primitive, the payload either swaps its own credentials for root's (`init_cred`) or asks the kernel to execute a helper program as UID 0 - on hardened devices like recent Samsungs (where KDP protects credentials), it forges a kernel work item instead. Disabling SELinux enforcement along the way is part of most chains.
4. **Install a root manager for the session.** With a root shell in hand, the tool runs `ksud` to late-load a **KernelSU** (or ReSukiSU) loadable kernel module. You now have the familiar manager app, `su` prompts, and module support.
5. **Everything lives in memory.** Nothing was flashed. The bootloader still contains the stock, signed boot image - it simply loaded a kernel that was exploited at runtime. **Rebooting wipes it all away.**

> [!NOTE]
> Because the exploit manipulates kernel timing, several tools ask you to run them **within ~30 seconds of booting** for the best reliability. A failed run usually just panics or reboots the kernel - you try again.

## What GhostLock root CAN do

Think of it as "full root, rented by the boot":

- **Grant root to apps and modules.** A fully working KernelSU/ReSukiSU manager for the session: root file managers, backup tools, LSPosed-style frameworks that can load as modules, ad-blockers writing hosts files - most things you'd do with normal root, minus anything that needs flashing.
- **Keep the bootloader locked.** The device still reports a locked, verified boot chain. On Samsung, that means **Knox is not tripped**: Secure Folder, Samsung Wallet/Pass, and health features keep working. Play Integrity verdicts remain intact because the device genuinely still looks stock.
- **No data wipe, no flashing, no PC required.** Nothing is written to disk partitions. Nothing in the verified-boot chain changes. If you reboot and never run the tool again, the phone is bone-stock again.
- **Be re-triggered on demand.** Want root for ten minutes to restore a backup or freeze an app, then be effectively stock? Run the app, do the thing, reboot. Some projects (via ReSukiSU integration) can even auto-re-trigger at boot.
- **Run on devices that *can't* unlock.** Flagships sold with no bootloader-unlock path (recent Snapdragon Galaxies are the headline example) are reachable this way - as long as their kernel build is vulnerable. Ports now cover older flagships (Galaxy S22 Ultra), foldables (Z Fold6, OPPO Find N2), mid-rangers (iQOO Z9 5G, POCO M6 Pro), Amazon hardware on 5.X kernels, and even the Meta Quest 1 VR headset.

## What GhostLock root CANNOT do

This is equally important, and overselling it is how people brick phones:

- **It cannot survive a reboot.** There is no persistence. Root exists only in memory for the current boot. Every reboot means re-running the tool (and modules that expect to survive reboots may misbehave).
- **It cannot flash anything.** Custom ROMs, custom kernels, custom recoveries (TWRP/OrangeFox) all require an unlocked bootloader to install. GhostLock does not change that - the bootloader is still locked and still verifies everything.
- **It cannot rescue a bricked device.** A locked bootloader gives you "practically zero" recovery options if something goes catastrophically wrong elsewhere. Ironically, this method is safest *because* you can't flash - but don't mistake it for a recovery tool.
- **It cannot take OTA updates and keep working.** Each monthly security patch can (and eventually will) close the hole. Tools generally require firmware on or before the **June 2026** patch level; some July 2026 builds still work, but that shrinks with every bulletin. Staying on old firmware means accumulating other unpatched vulnerabilities - a real security trade-off.
- **It cannot run on just any device.** Exploitation needs per-device, per-kernel-build offsets. Newer devices (e.g. the Galaxy S26 series) shipped with a memory layout this specific exploit family can't hit. If nobody ported offsets for your exact firmware, it won't work.
- **It cannot hide forever.** Even with the bootloader reading "locked," some security-focused apps can still detect the *artifacts* of rooting (manager apps, su binaries, module files) on disk. The bug hides the bootloader state, not the apps you install afterward - see [Root Hiding & Play Integrity apps](/apps-and-modules/root-management#root-hiding-play-integrity) for that half of the problem.
- **It cannot outlive the patch cycle.** OEMs are actively shipping the fix. Treat every GhostLock tool as a **short-lived, closing window**, not a permanent root method. Check the linked repos for current status before relying on one.

## All apps and projects for GhostLock

Everything public that implements or enables CVE-2026-43499 temporary root, grouped by how you use it. Star counts and device tables change fast - always check the repo's supported-devices file before trying one.

### One-tap apps (easiest)

- **[⭐ GhostLock App](https://github.com/YuKongA/ghostlock-app)** - One-tap execution app for the GhostLock exploit - install, open, tap, rooted for the session. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
- **[⭐ Root My Galaxy](https://github.com/BuSung-dev/Root-My-Galaxy)** - The original one-click implementation, for Snapdragon Galaxy flagships (S24/S25 series, S24 FE, A56, and others). Bootloader stays locked, Knox isn't tripped, so Secure Folder, Samsung Wallet, and Play Integrity keep working. Functions as a KernelSU installer with per-device exploit profiles. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
  - **[Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads](https://github.com/BuSung-dev/Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads)** - Companion repo with the signed per-device exploit offsets, kernel profiles, and KernelSU artifacts the app fetches at runtime. Adding support for a new device means porting a profile here. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
- **[GhostLock-Galaxy](https://github.com/wxxsfxyzm/GhostLock-Galaxy)** - App + CLI for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 (SM-F9560, kernel 6.1). Takes the shell-permission route: start Shizuku via wireless debugging (or use `adb shell`), grant the app, tap **Run**. The kernel is matched against the offset table via `uname -r` at startup, and unsupported kernels are rejected immediately; the repo also documents offset extraction from `boot.img`/`xbl_config.img`. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
- **[iQOO Z9 5G / vivo T3 5G Root](https://github.com/ankitrawatgit/iQOO-Z9_5G-vivo-T3_5G-Root-GhostLock)** - One-tap root app plus payloads for the iQOO Z9 5G and vivo T3 5G (MediaTek Dimensity 7200 / MT6886, kernel 5.15) - a rare GhostLock port for vivo-family devices. `FOSS`
- **[Root My Pixel](https://github.com/alex193a/Root-My-Pixel)** - Port for Google Pixel devices. Uses Shizuku to stage the payload without needing prior root or a PC, then runs the exploit to install ReSukiSU/KernelSU for the session. `FOSS`
- **[Root My Galaxy SM-S918B](https://github.com/soumarcelino/Root-My-Galaxy-SM-S918B)** - Root My Galaxy for Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra SM-S918B. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
- **[Root My Device](https://github.com/Witaqua-tools/Root-My-Device)** - Community fork of Root My Galaxy, generalized beyond Samsung with its own payload feed for additional firmware builds. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
- **[root-my-nothing](https://github.com/ang3lo-azevedo/root-my-nothing)** - One-click temporary root for the Nothing Phone (1); installs KernelSU without unlocking the bootloader. `FOSS`
- **[root my device (nothing phone 3a)](https://github.com/techtornados/Root-My-Device)** - OneClick root application for the Nothing Phone (3a). Forked of a different repo that was limited to the Japanese version of the nothing phone 3a. `FOSS` (Apache-2.0)
### Command-line exploits & device ports (for tinkerers)

- **[ghostlock-oneplus](https://github.com/JoinChang/ghostlock-oneplus)** - The most developed standalone exploit: root + KernelSU on OnePlus/OPPO/realme devices with a locked bootloader (OnePlus 13/15, Ace 6T, OPPO Pad 4 Pro, and even Xiaomi 17). Runtime kernel auto-detection with a multi-device offset table, a phone-standalone "bootstrap" mode, and optional auto-re-trigger at boot via ReSukiSU. Run it within ~30 seconds of boot for best reliability. `FOSS`
- **[GhostLock-5.10](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/GhostLock-5.10)** - Kernel root exploit for some 5.X-kernel devices - mostly Amazon hardware - from the developer behind Kaeru and Fenrir. Proof that the bug reaches older kernels, not just GKI 6.12 flagships. `FOSS`
- **[ghostlock-emerald](https://github.com/datfooldive/ghostlock-emerald)** - GhostLock port for the POCO M6 Pro ("emerald", MediaTek Helio G99 Ultra / MT6789) with locked bootloader; roots and installs KernelSU. `FOSS`
- **[ghostlock-a17](https://github.com/mobilehackinglab/ghostlock-a17)** - Full user-to-root chain for the Samsung Galaxy A17 (SM-A175F, Android 16 / GKI 6.12). Notable because it defeats **Samsung KDP** (kernel data protection) by forging a kernel work item instead of writing credentials, and ships a per-boot root shell (`g4d`/`g4sh`). `FOSS`
- **[IonStack-S22U](https://github.com/sarabpal-dev/IonStack-S22U)** - Full CVE-2026-43499 exploit chain for the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (5.10 kernel) - extends coverage to an older flagship generation. `FOSS`
- **[oppo-ghostlock](https://github.com/pubglite55/oppo-ghostlock)** - GhostLock exploit adaptation for the OPPO Find N2 foldable. `FOSS`
- **[pixel-ksu-root](https://github.com/JingMatrix/pixel-ksu-root)** - ADB-driven KernelSU loader for stock Google Pixels, from the maintainer of LSPosed/Vector. Gets temporary kernel read/write via GhostLock, then late-loads a signature-matched `kernelsu.ko` for the running KMI - manager-agnostic, so it works with any KernelSU-fork manager. `FOSS`
- **[QuestStack](https://github.com/starseed12345/QuestStack)** - Unlocks the **Meta Quest 1** (VR headset) bootloader and gains root using GhostLock combined with CVE-2021-1931 - a striking example of the technique reaching beyond phones. `FOSS`
- **[smt878u-ionstack-poc](https://github.com/Wtrwx/smt878u-ionstack-poc)** - Pure-C re-root proof-of-concept for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ (SM-T878U), demonstrating re-triggering IonStack/GhostLock root after reboot. `FOSS`

### Research, foundations & supporting projects

- **[CyberMeowfia (NebuSec)](https://github.com/NebuSec/CyberMeowfia)** - The original IonStack research writeup and exploit source for CVE-2026-43499 that every tool above is built on. Read this if you want to understand the bug itself.
- **[CVE-2026-43499-popsicle (x-spy)](https://github.com/x-spy/CVE-2026-43499-popsicle)** - Clean reference implementation of the exploit for GKI 6.12 kernels; credited as a base by several of the device ports above. `FOSS`
- **[KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU)** - The kernel-based root framework every GhostLock tool installs for the session (loaded as a module via `ksud`).
- **[ReSukiSU](https://github.com/ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU)** - KernelSU fork favored by several GhostLock tools; its `ksud` provides the late-load (LKM) install path and its app bundles the needed module binaries. Also powers the auto-re-trigger-at-boot integrations.
- **[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku)** - Not root-related by itself, but Root My Pixel (and similar apps) use it to stage the exploit payload with ADB-level privileges - no prior root needed.
- **[Kaeru / Fenrir & other MediaTek bootloader tools](./temporary-root-solutions.md)** - A *different* route to "root-like" results on a locked device (bootloader patching rather than kernel exploitation). Covered on the [Temporary Root for Android: Methods & Solutions](./temporary-root-solutions.md) page.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only download these tools from the GitHub repositories linked above. Fake "one-click root" apps shipping malware ride every exploit hype cycle, and a malicious "GhostLock" APK would be a perfect vehicle. Verify the repo, prefer building from source, and read the code if you're able.

## Device support at a glance

A snapshot of publicly verified targets - **not** a guarantee for your exact firmware. Patch level matters as much as model.

| Project | Verified devices (examples) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Root My Galaxy | Galaxy S24/S25 series, S24 FE, A56 | Snapdragon models; ≤ ~June 2026 patch |
| Root My Pixel | Google Pixel series | Stages via Shizuku; ≤ ~June 2026 patch |
| ghostlock-oneplus | OnePlus 13 / 15, Ace 6T, OPPO Pad 4 Pro, Xiaomi 17 | Auto-detects kernel; some Aug 2026 builds reported working |
| ghostlock-emerald | POCO M6 Pro (MT6789) | MediaTek port |
| ghostlock-a17 | Galaxy A17 (SM-A175F) | Bypasses Samsung KDP; July 2026 SPL verified |
| root-my-nothing | Nothing Phone (1) | One-click |
| smt878u-ionstack-poc | Galaxy Tab S7+ (SM-T878U) | Re-root POC |
| GhostLock-Galaxy | Galaxy Z Fold6 (SM-F9560) | Kernel 6.1 / Android 14; Shizuku or `adb shell` staging |
| oppo-ghostlock | OPPO Find N2 | Exploit adaptation |
| IonStack-S22U | Galaxy S22 Ultra | 5.10 kernel (older flagship) |
| GhostLock-5.10 | Mostly Amazon devices | 5.X kernels - older than GKI |
| iQOO Z9 5G / vivo T3 5G Root | iQOO Z9 5G, vivo T3 5G | Dimensity 7200 (MT6886), kernel 5.15 |
| pixel-ksu-root | Google Pixel (stock) | Manager-agnostic KernelSU late-load via ADB |
| QuestStack | Meta Quest 1 | Bootloader unlock + root (GhostLock + CVE-2021-1931) |

Devices shipping **after** mid-2026 (e.g. Galaxy S26 series) or running kernels already carrying the backported fix are **not** exploitable by this family.

## GhostLock vs. normal rooting (Magisk/KernelSU/APatch)

| | Normal root (Magisk/KernelSU/APatch) | GhostLock temporary root |
|---|---|---|
| Bootloader | **Must be unlocked** (data wipe) | **Stays locked** |
| Knox e-fuse | Tripped on Samsung | **Not tripped** |
| Survives reboot | Yes | **No** - re-run each boot |
| Custom ROMs / recovery / kernels | Yes | **No** |
| Play Integrity out of the box | Needs hiding stack | Still intact (device reads as stock) |
| Module support | Full | Session-only, via KernelSU/ReSukiSU |
| OTA updates | Managed, re-patch after | **Blocked** - updating likely kills root |
| Device coverage | Broad | Narrow, per-device, patch-level dependent |
| Longevity | A method, stays working | A **closing window**, already being patched |

**Rule of thumb:** if your device *can* unlock its bootloader and you want permanent root, use the normal method - start with the [Root Framework Comparison](./root-framework-comparison.md). GhostLock is for devices that can't unlock, users who absolutely cannot lose Knox/Wallet/Secure Folder, or anyone who only needs root occasionally and wants to stay stock otherwise.

## Is it safe? Risks and common sense

- **For your hardware:** comparatively low risk. Nothing is flashed or written to partitions, so the classic brick scenarios mostly don't apply. A failed exploit run typically ends in a kernel panic and reboot.
  Some modules though, can cause boot loop which isn't restorable on a device without unlocked bootloader. A list of known working/non working modules can be found [here](https://xdaforums.com/t/list-of-modules-working-on-temporal-root.4796105/)
- **For your software:** it is still privilege-escalation code running as root on your kernel. Only use the linked, source-available projects; avoid random APKs claiming "GhostLock root".
- **For your security posture:** staying on pre-June/July-2026 firmware to keep temp root means skipping real security fixes - including fixes for other exploitable bugs. Weigh that honestly. (This is the same trade-off as delaying any update for root.)
- **For the ecosystem:** these are research tools from small teams. Expect per-device rough edges, and check each repo's issue tracker for current firmware support before updating anything.

See the project's [Legal & Safety](../legal-disclaimer.md) page for the disclaimer that applies to everything in this repository.

## FAQ

**Q: Does GhostLock root trip Knox?**
No. Knox trips when the bootloader is unlocked. GhostLock never touches the bootloader, so the e-fuse stays intact and Secure Folder, Samsung Wallet, and Play Integrity keep working.

**Q: Will it work on the latest update?**
Probably not. The tools target firmware up to roughly the June 2026 security patch (a few July builds still work). OEMs are shipping the fix - Samsung was widely expected to close it in the August 2026 bulletin. If you updated past the supported patch level, you're out of luck.

**Q: Can I make it persistent?**
Not really. Rebooting clears it by design - that's the trade for keeping the bootloader locked. Some tools (via ReSukiSU) can auto-re-trigger after each boot, which is close, but a factory reset or update still ends it.

**Q: Do I need a computer?**
Usually not. Apps like Root My Galaxy and the GhostLock App handle everything on-device (some use Shizuku or wireless ADB, which the app walks you through). The CLI ports like ghostlock-oneplus are more comfortable with ADB.

**Q: Is this the same as the MediaTek bootloader tools (Kaeru/Fenrir)?**
No - different technique, same "avoid the unlocked bootloader" goal. Kaeru/Fenrir patch the bootloader itself and require flashing; GhostLock exploits the kernel in memory. See the [Temporary Root for Android: Methods & Solutions](./temporary-root-solutions.md) page for that side.

**Q: My device isn't listed anywhere - can I add it?**
Possibly. The exploits need per-device offsets; ghostlock-oneplus documents how to extract them from just a `boot.img`, GhostLock-Galaxy ships a `tools/extract_target.py` that parses them from `boot.img` + `xbl_config.img`, and Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads explains the profile format.
