# How to Unlock an Android Bootloader

**Bootloader unlocking is the usual first step before permanent Android root, custom recovery or a custom ROM.** The process varies by manufacturer and model, but it normally enables OEM unlocking, uses ADB/Fastboot or a vendor tool, and factory-resets the phone. Check the exact model and region before you follow any command.

## What is an Android bootloader?

The bootloader is your device's startup manager - the first program that runs when powering on, responsible for loading the operating system and enforcing security policies.

## Should You Unlock Your Bootloader?

**Unlocking enables:**
- **Custom recovery installation** (TWRP, OrangeFox)
- **Root access** via Magisk, KernelSU
- **Custom ROM installation** (LineageOS, GrapheneOS)
- **Kernel modifications** for performance tuning
- **Advanced system modifications** and tweaks

### Locked vs Unlocked

| Locked Bootloader | Unlocked Bootloader |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Maximum security | Full customization freedom |
| OTA updates work seamlessly | Can install custom ROMs |
| Banking apps work normally | Can install custom recovery |
| Cannot install custom software | Root access possible |
| Limited modification | Warranty void (usually) |

> [!TIP]
> **Can't unlock, or unlocking isn't worth the trade-offs?** On a narrow set of devices, the **GhostLock** bug (CVE-2026-43499) provides **temporary, reboot-to-clear root on a locked bootloader** - no wipe, no Knox trip. It can't flash ROMs or recoveries, but it may cover occasional root needs. See [Root Without Unlocking the Bootloader](./root-without-unlocking-bootloader.md) and the broader [Temporary Root Solutions](./temporary-root-solutions.md) page.

---

## Prerequisites

### ⚠️ Critical Warnings

::: danger IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
**Data Erasure** - Unlocking bootloader completely wipes all data. Backup everything before proceeding.

**Warranty Void** - Most manufacturers permanently void warranty. Some devices show permanent unlock warnings.

**Banking Apps** - Many financial apps detect unlocked bootloaders and refuse to work.

**Device Security** - Unlocked bootloaders reduce device security. Physical access can compromise data.
:::

### Essential Requirements

**Hardware**
- Android device with unlockable bootloader
- 50% or higher battery charge
- Quality USB cable (data-capable)
- Computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

**Software**
- [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (ADB/Fastboot)
- Device-specific USB drivers (Windows)
- Manufacturer-specific tools (Mi Unlock Tool, Odin, etc.)

**Knowledge**
- Basic command line usage
- Device model and variant identification
- Ability to follow instructions precisely

### Manufacturer Policy Overview

| Manufacturer | Typical method | Waiting period | Important limitation |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Google Pixel | Fastboot command | Usually none | OEM Unlocking must be available; carrier variants can differ. |
| OnePlus | Fastboot command | Usually none | T-Mobile and some regional variants have extra restrictions. |
| Nothing | Fastboot command | Usually none | Confirm the model's current unlock policy. |
| Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO | Mi Unlock Tool | Often 7–30 days | Mi Account binding and Xiaomi policy apply. |
| Motorola | Unlock code | Usually none | The exact model must qualify for an unlock code. |

## Post-Unlock Steps

After the phone reboots and you complete initial setup, choose a root method rather than flashing files at random. Continue with the [Magisk root guide](./magisk-guide.md), [KernelSU guide](./kernelsu-guide.md) or [APatch guide](./apatch-guide.md). If you need a recovery first, follow the [custom recovery installation guide](./how-to-install-custom-recovery.md).
After successfully unlocking bootloader:

### Step 1: Initial Setup

Device boots to setup wizard (all data erased).

1. Complete Android setup process
2. Re-enable Developer Options (tap Build Number 7 times)
3. Enable USB Debugging again
4. Optionally re-enable OEM Unlocking (for future modifications)

### Step 2: Verify Unlock

```bash
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot getvar unlocked
```

Should return: `unlocked: yes` or `unlocked: 1`

Or:
```bash
fastboot oem device-info
```

Look for "Device unlocked: true"

### Step 3: Next Steps

**Typical progression:**

1. **Install Custom Recovery** (optional but recommended)
   - [TWRP Installation Guide](./how-to-install-custom-recovery.md) - Enables easier rooting and backups

2. **Root Your Device** - Choose your preferred method:
   - [Magisk Guide](./magisk-guide.md) - Most popular, easiest for beginners
   - [KernelSU Guide](./kernelsu-guide.md) - Advanced kernel-level root with superior hiding
   - [APatch Guide](./apatch-guide.md) - Alternative kernel-based solution
   - [Compare all methods](./root-framework-comparison.md)

3. **Post-Root Configuration**
   - Install [essential starter apps](../apps-and-modules/#starter-kit-must-have-apps)
   - Configure [system-wide ad blocking](../general-guides/android-adblocking.md)
   - [Safely remove bloatware](../general-guides/android-apps-debloating.md)
   - Browse [600+ root apps and modules](../apps-and-modules/)

### Step 4: Security Considerations

**Important reminders:**
- Banking apps may detect unlocked bootloader (see [root hiding solutions](../apps-and-modules/root-management#root-hiding-play-integrity))
- Set up strong screen lock
- Only install trusted software
- Be cautious with root permissions
- Keep device software updated
